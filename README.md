# AirBNB-Analysis
Using a large dataset of Airbnb data from multiple European Cities, I analyzed specific variables to see how they influenced price.
The following variables were analyzed:
1. Distance from city center
 2. Superhost Status
3. Room type
4. Cleanliness Rating

RStudio was used to clean, process and analyze dataset. See airBNB document for code details.
